The idea behind backtracking is to build a solution incrementally and remove partial solutions that cannot be completed to a valid solution. In this case, we start with an empty string and gradually add opening and closing parentheses to it until we get a valid combination of balanced parentheses.

We start with an empty stack and an empty list called res which will store the final output.

We define a recursive function called backtrack which takes two arguments, openN and closedN, representing the number of open and closed parentheses added to the stack so far.

The base case of the recursion is when openN and closedN are both equal to n. In this case, we have added n opening and n closing parentheses to the stack, and we append the current contents of the stack to the res list.

If the base case is not satisfied, we can add either an opening or a closing parenthesis to the stack, depending on the current values of openN and closedN.

If we have added less than n opening parentheses so far, we add an opening parenthesis to the stack and recursively call the backtrack function with openN + 1 and closedN.

If we have added fewer closing parentheses than opening parentheses, we add a closing parenthesis to the stack and recursively call the backtrack function with openN and closedN + 1.

Once we have completed all recursive calls, we return the final output list res.

The key insight behind this algorithm is that a valid combination of parentheses must always start with an opening parenthesis and end with a closing parenthesis, and every opening parenthesis must have a corresponding closing parenthesis later in the string. By using backtracking, we can explore all possible combinations of parentheses in a systematic way and eliminate invalid solutions as we go.
