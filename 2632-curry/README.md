Now, let's imagine you have a box. Inside this box, there is a special recipe written on a piece of paper. The recipe requires some ingredients to make a delicious dish. However, instead of giving all the ingredients to the recipe at once, we want to give them one by one.

The curry function helps us achieve this. It creates a new function called curried. This curried function is like a helper that allows us to provide the ingredients gradually to the original recipe.

When we first call curry and pass a function fn to it, it creates the curried function. Now, when we call curried with some arguments (ingredients), it checks if we have given enough ingredients to make the dish by comparing the number of ingredients we provided (args.length) with the number of ingredients the original recipe (fn) requires (fn.length).

If we have given enough ingredients, it means we can now make the dish! In that case, the curried function uses fn.apply(this, args) to call the original recipe (fn) with all the ingredients we provided.

But what if we haven't given enough ingredients yet? In that case, the curried function creates a new function that acts just like itself, but with the ingredients we have provided so far. This new function is created using curried.bind(this, ...args). It's like making a copy of the curried function with some ingredients already filled in, and we can keep adding more ingredients to it later.

This process continues until we give all the ingredients needed by the original recipe. And each time we provide an ingredient, the curried function either calls the original recipe if it has all the ingredients or creates a new function with the ingredients provided so far.

So, by using the curry function, we can gradually provide the ingredients to a recipe and make the dish when we have all the necessary ingredients. It's like preparing the recipe step by step, just like how you would add ingredients one by one when cooking something delicious.
